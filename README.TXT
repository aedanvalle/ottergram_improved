Class: CPSC 349 - section 2
Project number: 2

Project Description: 
	This project was altered from the ch.4 and ch.7
	The purpose for this assignment was to learn more about CSS transitions and 
	integrate picture rotation with buttons so that it was easier to flip through
	all the photographs.  Getting used to more dynamic interaction with the user
	was what they project was about.  My last 2 pictures for grid garden and 
	flex box froggy are there towards the end.
